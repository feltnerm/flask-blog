# bloggity

This here contains _at least_ a blog. My first foray into web app programming with Python led to me trying to design the _coup de gras_ of all web apps. It got a little big. Especially for my humble needs.

So, the blog engine works. I believe the pastebin works, but needs to be added to the config/settings/whatever. There are a lot of bits and pieces. Some of them may, or may not, work. It could be a good starting point for someone wanting to to learn MongoDB, Flask, Python, Skeleton CSS framework, &c.

enjoi.
