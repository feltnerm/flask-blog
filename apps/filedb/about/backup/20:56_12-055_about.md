# About Me
_Mark Feltner_

## Who Are You?
I am Mark Feltner. Student, soccer player, code ninja, & DJ.I'm a self-proclaimed inventor, philosopher, and hacker. I enjoy getting my mind blown. Things that blow my mind:
*space
*love
*art
*music
*programming
*reading
*technology
*coincidences...

Currently, I reside in Platteville, Wisconsin, and I am attending the University of Wisconsin Platteville as a student of Computer Science. 

## What Are You Doing Here?
Not sure. I made this blogging engine as a side project, and now I'm _testing_ it.

## What the Heck Is Experientiarum?
*experientiarum* (noun): experiences; experiences gained from experiments

This place is going to be my little corner of the web to emit my experiences and experiment with those experiences whilst experiencing them. It's very Inception-esque.
