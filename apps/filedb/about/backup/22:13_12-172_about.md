<h1>About Me</h1><h2>Who Are You?</h2><br>I am Mark Feltner. Student, soccer player, code ninja, &amp; DJ.I'm a self-proclaimed inventor, philosopher, and hacker. I enjoy getting my mind blown. Things that blow my mind:&nbsp;<br><span><br><blockquote>space, love, art, music, programming, reading, technology, coincidences</blockquote>

Currently, I reside in Platteville, Wisconsin, and I am attending the University of Wisconsin Platteville as a student of Computer Science. 

What Are You Doing Here?

Not sure. I made this blogging engine as a side project, and now I'm <i>testing</i> it.</span><br>
<h2>What the Heck Is Experientiarum?</h2><br>
<blockquote><b>experientiarum</b> (noun): <i>experiences; experiences gained from experiments</i></blockquote>This place is going to be my little corner of the web to emit my experiences and experiment with those experiences whilst experiencing them. It's very Inception-esque.
