Alternate Heading Syntax
-------------------------------------

First-level heading
===================

Second-level heading
--------------------

Blockquotes
------------------

> "This entire paragraph of text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element.
Blockquote elements are reflowable. You may arbitrarily
wrap the text to your liking, and it will all be parsed
into a single blockquote element."

Links
-------

[link text here](link.address.here "link title here")

Alternatively, links can be placed in footnotes outside of the paragraph, being referenced with some sort of reference tag. For example, including the following inline:
[link text here][linkref]
would produce a link if the following showed up outside of the paragraph (or at the end of the document):
[linkref]: link.address.here "link title here"
